## Project Goals
1. **Predictive Modeling**: Build and deploy a robust machine learning model to predict employee attrition.
2. **Insight Generation**: Identify and analyze the most influential factors driving employee turnover.
3. **Actionable Recommendations**: Provide HR teams with data-driven insights to implement retention strategies.
4. **MLOps Integration**: Implement MLOps practices for scalable, real-time model monitoring and updates.
5. **Interactive Dashboards**: Develop interactive visualizations and dashboards to track attrition trends and model performance.
6. **Business Impact**: Deliver a final presentation showcasing the model's insights and its potential impact on organizational outcomes.
